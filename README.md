This game is one of my first in JavaScript. I made it as an assignment of the Front-End course in Kodilla. I also modified this game adding two more options: Lizard and Spock.


You want to play? It's very simple: 

Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitates Lizard, Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock and as it always has, Rock crushes Scissors. 

The game is up to 10 points. Enjoy!
